# Vectors

In mathematics and physics, a vector is a term that refers to some quantities that cannot be expressed 
by a single number or to elements of some vector spaces.

Historically, geometry and physics introduced vectors with both a magnitude and a direction for 
quantities such as displacements, forces and speed.
